# Types of machine learning
# 1. Supervised Learning   --lebelled dataset, structured,
'''
Common algorithms in Supervised Learning
-Linear Regression
-Logistic Regression
-Decision Trees
-Support vector Machines (SVM)
-K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
-Random Forest (RF)

-Deep Learning (CNN) - image classification building  .h5

# 2. Unsupervised Learning -unlabeled data, discovering hidden patterns, clusters, structures

'''
- K-means clustering
-Hierarchical clustering
-PCA

# Model selection and validation


# 3. Semi supervised learning
# 4. Reinforcement learning -rewards
